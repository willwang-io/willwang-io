# Hey, I'm Will 👋

Software developer based in Canada with 3 years of professional experience building performance-critical desktop tooling. Now focused on web and system development with Rust and Python.

I care about writing clean, well-tested code and solving hard problems — my CS & Math double honours background means I'm equally comfortable with algorithm design and shipping production software. 

## What I'm working on now

- **Open-source contributor** to [rocketmq-rust](https://github.com/mxsm/rocketmq-rust) — refactoring internals, implementing features, and participating in code review on a real-world Rust messaging system
- **[Nonogram Solver](https://nonogram-solver.willwang.io/)** — Rust + Dioxus web app with step-by-step visualization, using a relaxation + 2-SAT solving framework
- **[Solo Chess Solver](https://solo-chess-solver.willwang.io/)** — Interactive browser-based puzzle solver with move validation and solution playback

## Tech I work with

**Languages:** Rust, Python, C++, JavaScript  
**Web:** React, Next.js, Tailwind, Dioxus  
**Backend:** FastAPI, Actix Web, PostgreSQL, Redis  
**Infra:** AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53), Docker, Cloudflare

## Get in touch

I'm open to software developer roles across Canada, remote, hybrid and on-site are all fine — no sponsorship needed.
